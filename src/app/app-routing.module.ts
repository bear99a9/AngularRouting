// In our example, we didn't encounter any issues when we tried to redirect the user. But that's not always the case when adding redirections.

// By default, Angular matches paths by prefix. That means, that the following route will match both /recipes  and just / 

// { path: '', redirectTo: '/somewhere-else' } 

// Actually, Angular will give you an error here, because that's a common gotcha: This route will now ALWAYS redirect you! Why?

// Since the default matching strategy is "prefix" , Angular checks if the path you entered in the URL does start with the path specified in the route. Of course every path starts with ''  (Important: That's no whitespace, it's simply "nothing").

// To fix this behavior, you need to change the matching strategy to "full" :

// { path: '', redirectTo: '/somewhere-else', pathMatch: 'full' } 

// Now, you only get redirected, if the full path is ''  (so only if you got NO other content in your path in this example).

        // We are using fake urls here, unlike in a traditional website, where the urls usually reflect the real places of the subpages.
        // In a SPA, when changing the url, we are not really moving to a different place but we only shift some content of the current view. 
        //Manipulating the urls in this way is only possible in modern browsers which support the History API. 
        //In older browsers you can mimic a similar behavior by using hashes for internal navigation on a page.
